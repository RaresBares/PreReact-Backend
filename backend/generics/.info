TODO

TODO in the Future: Gnerics have the role to make the Code more modular. Features are signlevalued static
TODO quantitative evaluations like: media, Peak-To-Peak, etc. Methods, are vectorvalued static quantitative
TODO evaluations like: FFT, STFT, WAVELET etc. The Code doesnt rely on modularism and dynamics therefore
TODO this is planned in future time.
